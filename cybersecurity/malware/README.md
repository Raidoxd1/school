## Description

You need to develop a ransomware that encrypt all the files with your extension and add a text file in the desktop with "All of your files have been<br> encrypted,To unlock them contact me with your encryption code in this email@email.com, your encryption code is : {xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}". a random <br>encryption code must be placed in the text file, you must use this encryption code to provide an decrypting program. <br>

Your Malware and decryption program must be developed to work in Windows environment. The programs should not detect with Windows Defender and in more <br>than 80% of Security vendors in virustotal, yes it's hard but your program will be useless if it's detected!<br>

## Q&A

1. Explain clearly what ransomware means?<br>
Ransomware: Malicious software that encrypts files or locks up your computer, demanding money for their release.
<br><br>

2. Explain clearly how can someone bypass the Anti-Viruses?<br>
Example: Obfuscation: simply distorts the malware while keeping its form. A simple example would be randomizing the case of the characters in a PowerShell script.<br><br>

3. How my ransomware works?    <br>
My program works simply by waiting for the user to open a random .exe file and then it encrypts some random files with a random key.
<br><br>

4. How my decryption program works?    <br>
Decryption works by finding the files that have the extension(in my case the .HAHA) from directory and its subdirectories.<br>
Then it needs the key that the files were encrypted with and then it will decrypt them<br>




## Usage

I used "auto_py_to_exe" to convert the encrypt.py to an executable file. <br>
